## About

This is a comprehensive, sourced deconstruction of the website TERFisaSlur.com — a propaganda tool that employs selective documentation, logical fallacies, and historically-proven manipulation tactics to delegitimise trans people and their allies.

When someone drops a link to TERFisaSlur.com in an argument, this is your counter.

## What This Resource Does

- **Debunks the foundational claim** — "TERF" is not a slur. It's a descriptive acronym coined by cisgender feminists in 2008.
- **Exposes the methodology** — Cherry-picking, composition fallacy, false equivalence, suppressed evidence, circular reasoning.
- **Names the trap** — The Provocation-Reaction cycle and DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender).
- **Provides historical context** — The same playbook has been used against every civil rights movement in modern history.
- **Offers direct rebuttals** — Ready-to-use responses to common arguments.

## The Manipulation Cycle

```
1. OPPRESS    → Legislative attacks, social exclusion, harassment
       ↓
2. PROVOKE    → Constant dehumanisation generates anger
       ↓
3. DOCUMENT   → Collect examples of that anger
       ↓
4. JUSTIFY    → Use the anger as "proof" oppression is warranted
       ↓
   (Return to step 1 with renewed justification)
```

Sites like TERFisaSlur.com exist at step 3. Understanding the full cycle breaks its power.

## Key Facts

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "TERF is a slur" | It's a descriptive acronym; academics agree it is not a slur |
| "Trans activists are violent" | Trans people face disproportionately *higher* rates of violence |
| "This documents harassment" | It selectively curates to misrepresent an entire community |
| "We're just protecting women" | Trans women are women; many cis women are trans allies |

## Why This Exists

> *"The measure of any civil rights movement's legitimacy has never been the perfect behaviour of all its members. It has been whether their cause is just. Trans people seek basic recognition, safety, and dignity. No collection of angry tweets changes that fundamental moral reality."*

Propaganda works through repetition without scrutiny. This resource provides the scrutiny.
